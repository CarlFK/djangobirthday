You'll learn the secrets of explaining the Internet, servers or Django ORM to people who never done this before. And how to find 100+ women who want to learn to code just about anywhere. This talk is your introduction to the world of getting girls excited about snakes, ponies and balloons."

Over the next few years I became a frequent contributor to Django, including becoming a core developer and later a member of the DSF board. Now I'm largely uninvolved with Django's development. This talk is the story of my time with Django. This talk is a walk through my time with Django -- from emailing Adrian to ask about attending a sprint that had already happened, to contributing patches, to the multi-db GSOC, to Eric Florenzano's keynote, becoming a core developer, joining the board, to slowly fading away and becoming an emeritus developer."

I'll be attempting to throw light on some of the dark secrets of Django and, perhaps, finally divine its true purpose, after almost a decade of searching."

As a primary person involved with Read the Docs, and Write the Docs, I have seen a lot of angles, and appreciate documentation more every year. I believe better documentation is a fundamental aspect of how we can improve programming culture, and an often misunderstood part of outreach and education. Read the Docs started in Lawrence, and has grown from there. This seems like the perfect venue to wax poetic about why documentation matters, and tell the story of Read the Docs along the way. The Django community is one where documentation has always been valued, and I think that understanding how it lead to its success and why it's an important virtue going forward is important. This talk will make you think more deeply about the social impact of documentation, and hopefully make you question if it should be a higher priority in your development. "
